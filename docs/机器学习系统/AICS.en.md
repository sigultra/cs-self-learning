Intelligent computing systems serve as the backbone for global AI, producing billions of devices annually, including smartphones, servers, and wearables. Training professionals for these systems is critical for China's AI industry competitiveness. Understanding intelligent computing systems is vital for computer science students, shaping their core skills.

Prof. Yunji Chen's course, taught in various universities, uses experiments to provide a holistic view of the AI tech stack. Covering deep learning frameworks, coding in low-level languages, and hardware design, the course fosters a systematic approach.

Personally, completing experiments 2-5 enhanced my grasp of deep learning frameworks. The BCL language experiment in chapter five is reminiscent of CUDA for those familiar.

I recommend the textbook for a comprehensive tech stack understanding. Deep learning-savvy students can start from chapter five to delve into deep learning framework internals.

Inspired by the course, I developed a [simple deep learning framework](https://github.com/ysj1173886760/PyToy) and plan a tutorial. Written in Python, it's code-light, suitable for students with some foundation. Future plans include more operators and potential porting to C++ for balanced performance and efficiency.
